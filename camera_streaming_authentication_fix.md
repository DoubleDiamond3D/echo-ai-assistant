# Camera Streaming Authentication Fix

## Issue
Camera streaming endpoints were not properly authenticated, allowing unauthorized access to live camera feeds.

## Solution
Implemented proper API key authentication for all camera streaming endpoints.

## Changes Made
- Added API key validation to camera streaming endpoints
- Enhanced security for live camera feeds
- Improved error handling for unauthorized access
- Added proper authentication headers

## Files Modified
- web/assets/app.js - Updated camera streaming authentication
- app/blueprints/api.py - Enhanced API key validation

## Testing
- Verified API key authentication works correctly
- Tested unauthorized access is properly blocked
- Confirmed camera streaming works with valid API keys

## Security Impact
- Prevents unauthorized access to camera feeds
- Ensures only authenticated users can view live streams
- Improves overall system security

## Deployment Notes
- No breaking changes for authenticated users
- Invalid API keys will receive 401 Unauthorized response
- Valid API keys continue to work as expected
